- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Miceli: @mmiceli99 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and using data to understand the worlds problems.
- ðŸŒ± I'm proficient in statistical regression in R, sql querying in large data bases, creating dashboards in tableau and while I very much prefer to use tidymodels in R for machine learning models, I have been learning to be better at using python for data prediction.
